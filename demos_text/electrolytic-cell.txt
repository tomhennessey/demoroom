Electrolytic Cell (KI)

Purpose

To demonstrate the reaction that occurs in an electrolytic cell through a change in the color of a solution.

Materials

1M KI

Phenolphthalein

Graphite Electrodes

Petri Dish

Alligator Clips

9-V battery

Procedure

1. Pour 1M KI solution into petri dish so that the bottom is covered by the solution. 2. Add 6-10 drops of phenolphthalein to the petri dish and gently swirl to mix. 3. Connect the graphite electrodes to each terminal of the 9-V battery with the alligator
clips. 4. Immerse the electrodes in the KI solution and observe the color changes.

Additional Information

1. At the Anode, the solution will turn a yellow-brown color. This is a result of the iodide anion (I-) oxidizing to I2. The color change is from the formation of triiodide ions (I3-).
2. At the Cathode, the solution will turn a pink color from the formation of OH- and the

solution around the electrode will bubble as H2 gas is formed.

3. The overall reactions are as follows:

Anode 2 I- → I2 + 2 e-

E° red (V) +0.54

Cathode 2 H2O + 2 e- → 2 OH- + H2

- 0.42

Disposal

After the demonstration, the solution can be poured down the sink with excess water.
