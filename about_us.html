	<div class="quote-left"><i>Working in the Demo Room was an unforgettable experience! The holiday show and community outreach was by far the most rewarding. It took long days and a lot of hard work but was completely worth it. Dr Ray dressed as Buddy the Elf was a classic staple to the end of the show. The faculty made my time here even better. You can instantly tell that they love their jobs and that they put their lives into helping students. I learned a lot about professional development, gained amazing friends, and loved learning more about my major. I truly appreciated this experience!</i> - Torie Nawa, “Demo Queen”, Student Worker September 2014-May 2016</div>

	<div class="quote-right"><i>" We are spoiled here with the demo room supplies and staff. Their outstanding work and professionalism is an essential part of educating our students.”</i> - Tom Hummel, Chemistry Lecturer</div>
	<div class="quote-right"><i>"The demo room taught me so much about chemistry, responsibility, and leadership.  I am truly grateful for the many hours and days spent within those 4 walls preparing experiments, reaching out to the community, and (a personal favorite) the annual holiday show.  This job brought me many mentors, teachers, inside jokes, and lifelong friendships.  It is an opportunity that I will always be grateful for having." </i> - Emilee "Demo Queen" Nawa, Student Worker January 2015- May 2017</div>
