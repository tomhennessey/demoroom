                                  LED in Liquid Nitrogen
Purpose
   To introduce electron band theory and semiconductors using an LED and to show how
   changing the bandgap in a semiconductor (via submersion in liquid nitrogen) also changes
   the energy that electrons release as they pass the gap, visible by a change in LED color.
Materials
   Liquid nitrogen                                       Alligator wires
   Small dewar                                           Stick
   LED                                                   DC Power supply
Procedure
   1. Attach the LED securely to the stick and connect the alligator wires to the LED and the
       power supply
   2. Prepare a small dewar filled with liquid nitrogen
   3. Turn on the power supply and submerge the LED in liquid nitrogen – the color should
       change

Disposal
   Liquid nitrogen dewar should be left in the hood to evaporate. LED may need to be replaced
   before next use.
