                           Iodine Clock Reaction (simplified/new)
Purpose
   To demonstrate the relationship between a concentration and the rate of a chemical reaction.
Materials
   potassium iodate solution (.2M, 175 mL)           400 mL beaker (3)
   Starch Solution (2%, 190 mL)                      10 mL graduated cylinder
   Sodium metabisulfite (3.8g)                       50 mL graduated cylinder
   Deionized water                                   100 mL graduated cylinder
   250 mL beaker (3)
Procedure
   Preparation â€“ best to prepare the day before
   1. Prepare 100 mL of a 0.2M sodium metabisulfite solution by dissolving 3.8g in 100 mL of
       deionized water.
   2. Prepare a 2% starch solution by adding 20g starch to 100 mL of deionized water. Pour
       starch paste into 1L of boiling water while stirring. Allow solution to cool (4-5 hours).
   3. Prepare a series of solutions called Solution A according to the following chart, using
       400 mL beakers:
                                     Beaker 1A              Beaker 2A             Beaker 3A
            KIO3 (0.2M)                50 mL                  100 mL                 25 mL
           Deionized Water            150 mL                  100 mL                175 mL
   4. Prepare 3 identical Solution B solutions by mixing 10 mL of 0.2M sodium metabisulfite
       solution, 30 mL of the starch solution, and 40 mL of deionized water in 250 mL beakers.
   Presentation
   1.      All at the same time:
        a.     Pour solution B into Solution 1A. Stir.
        b.     Pour solution B into Solution 2A. Stir.
        c.     Pour solution B into Solution 3A. Stir.
   2.      Observe the differences in time it takes each of the solutions to change color.
Additional Information
   1.      Mechanism for this reaction is not well understood.
                                                               Kinetics/Thermodynamics 7


Questions for the Students
   1.      Why is the amount of water changed in each trial?
   2.      Explain how concentration affects the rate at a molecular level.
   3.     What would happen if B varied instead of A?
Disposal
   Solutions should be placed in a properly labeled waste container with UI# 202140.
