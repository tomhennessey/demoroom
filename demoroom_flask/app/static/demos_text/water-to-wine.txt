                                          Water to Wine
Purpose
   To demonstrate concentration differences between acids and bases through color changes.
Materials
       4 display glasses                                1M NaOH
       Phenolphthalein                                  Sat. BaCl2
       2L Erlenmeyer flask                              6M H2SO4
Procedure
Preparation
   1.      Add 2-3 mL of phenolphthalein to a 2L Erlenmeyer flask and fill the flask with water.
   2.      In the first display glass put nothing, in the second add 1mL NaOH, in the third add
           1mL H2SO4 , and the fourth add 1 mL BaCl2
   3.      For the presentation, fill display glass 1 with the water/phenolphthalein solution.
           Then fill 2 with the water/phenolphthalein solution and notice the pink color change.
   4.      Pour the liquid contents from 1 and 2 with the grade/red solution and point out that
           these are still grape/red.
   5.      Fill 3 with the grape/red solution from the flask and note the colorless solution. Pour
           3, 2, and 1 back into the flask to return it all to the colorless solution
   6.      Fill 1,2, and 3 with the colorless solution, then fill 4 and watch as the colorless
           solution turns to a milky white color, the “milk”.
Story
   • 4 guests come to a dinner party
   •   Guest 1 with glass 1 asks for water, guest 2 asks for wine or Kool-Aid (procedure #3),
       now guest 1 decides she wants wine/Kool-Aid (procedure #4)
   •   Guest 3 with glass 3 asks for water (procedure #5)
   •   Guests 1 and 2 decide they also want water (follow step 5)
   •   Guest 4 with glass 4 asks for milk (procedure 6)
                                                                                         Acids/Bases 9


Safety
    Do not drink any of the solutions.
Disposal
The milk solution should be placed in a properly labelled waste container with UI# 202525 and
all other solutions may be poured down the drain with excess water.
Waste bottle: Barium chloride, phenolphthalein, sulfuric acid, water; UI# 202525
