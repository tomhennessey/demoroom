                                    Limiting Reactants (PbI2)
Purpose
   To demonstrate the concept of limiting reactants.
Materials
   5 test tubes                                         graduated cylinders
   water                                                0.10 M Pb(NO3)
   0.20 M NaI
Procedure
   1.       Add 10.0 mL of 0.10 M Pb(NO3)2 to each of the test tubes.
   2.       Add the following amounts of water to the respective test tubes: 8.0 mL, 6.0 mL,
            4.0 mL, 2.0 mL, 0 mL.
   3.       Add the following amounts of 0.20 M NaI to the respective test tubes: 2.0 mL,
            4.0 mL, 6.0 mL, 8.0 mL, 10.0 mL.
   4.       Let the test tubes sit for several minutes and notice the amounts of precipitants in
            each. There will be an increase in product from tubes 1 through 3, but this levels out
            in tubes 4 and 5.
Additional Information
   1.       Have the students predict what will happen before you add the NaI.
Disposal
   The solutions in the test tubes should be placed in properly labeled waste containers. Care
   should be taken when emptying out the test tubes to ensure all of the product gets washed
   into the waste container.
                                                                    Reactions: Limiting Reactants 61
