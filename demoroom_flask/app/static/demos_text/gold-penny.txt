                                          Gold Penny
Purpose
   To show the properties of metal and the process of wet chemical plating through the process
   of plating a penny in zinc then heating it up to form a brass alloy.
Materials
   Penny (MUST be pre 1982)                              Tongs
   3M NaOH (24g/200mL)                                   Paper towels
   Granular zinc                                         250 mL beaker of DI H2O
   Hot plate                                             Bunsen burner
   400 mL beaker
Procedure
   1.  Pour 200 mL of the 3M NaOH into the 400 mL beaker
   2.  Place the beaker on the hot plate and heat over medium-high heat. Do not boil.
   3.  Add 5g of granular zinc to the beaker
   4.  Place penny in the beaker and stir for 4 minutes
   5.  Using the tongs, remove penny from the NaOH solution and place in the beaker of water.
   6.  Remove penny from the water and rub with a paper towel to achieve a shiny silver look.
       The penny is now zinc plated.
   7. Using the tongs, place the penny in the flame of the Bunsen burner, slowly moving it
       back and forth across the flame.
   8. The heat will cause the zinc and copper atoms to mix forming a brass alloy, making the
       penny gold.
Additional Information
   1. The penny used must be from before 1982 due to the differences in composition of
       pennies. From 1962 to 1981, pennies were composed of 95% copper and 5% zinc. Where
       pennies from 1982 and after are comprised of 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper.
   2. The process in this demo is one that was historically used by alchemist to try to fool
       people into believing they could change common metals into gold.
Disposal
   The remaining solution should be placed in a properly labeled waste container with UI#
   100948.
