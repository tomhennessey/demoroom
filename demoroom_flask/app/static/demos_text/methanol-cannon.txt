                                    The Methanol Cannon
Purpose
   To demonstrate a combustion reaction ignited by a spark.
Materials
2L heavy plastic bottle                                Ring stand/clamp
Tesla coil                                             Cork stopper
Two nails                                              Methanol
Procedure
   1. Insert two large nails into the sides of the bottle. The points of the nails should be
       separated by about ¼” sized gap.
   2. Add about 1 mL of methanol to the bottle.
   3. Shake the bottle to vaporize and distribute the
       alcohol.
   4. Place a tight fitting cork into the mouth of the
       bottle.
   5. Fasten the bottle to a ring stand using a clamp
       on the neck of the bottle.
   6. Direct the cork up and away from the any
       students.
   7. Turn on the Tesla coil and apply a spark from
       the coil to the head of one of the nails or attach
       ignitor wires to the nails and spark them.
   8. A loud explosion will result and the cork will be propelled across the room.
Additional Information
   1.  The spark ignites the methanol vapor and a rapid combustion reaction will occur:
   2.  A blue flame of the reaction is clearly visible in a dark room.
   3.  Enough vapor may be left in the bottle for a second firing.
   4.  A smaller model for this combustion called a blaster and can be used to shoot a ping pong
       ball instead of a stopper.
Question for the Students
   1. Write a balanced equation for the reaction.
