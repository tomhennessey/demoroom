                                      The Silver Mirror
Purpose
   To demonstrate an oxidation-reduction reaction that effectively illustrates the reduction of
   silver ions to silver metal
Materials
   100 mL graduated cylinder                          dextrose
   250 mL Erlenmeyer flask                            fructose
   500 mL Florence flask                              silver nitrate
   3 150 mL beakers                                   ammonium nitrate
   50 mL beaker                                       tartaric acid
   sodium hydroxide                                   ethanol
   heating unit
   Solution A: Dissolve 2.5 grams of dextrose and 2.5 grams of fructose in 50 mL of distilled
   water. Add 0.6 gram of tartaric acid. Bring the solution to a boil, cool it, and pour into a 100
   mL graduated cylinder. Add 10 mL of ethanol and dilute to 100 mL.
   Solution B: Dissolve 4.0 grams of silver nitrate into 50 mL of H2O.
   Solution C: Dissolve 6.0 grams of ammonium nitrate into 50 mL of H2O.
   Solution D: Dissolve 10 grams of sodium hydroxide in 100 mL of H2O.
Procedure
   1.      Clean a 500 mL Florence flask thoroughly.
   2.      Place 30 mL of Solution A in the flask.
   3.      Mix 15 mL of Solution B with 15 mL of Solution C in a clean 50 mL beaker and add
           to the flask - donâ€™t mix until 1 hr. before demo. Explosive!
   4.      Quickly add 30 mL of Solution D to the flask and stopper it.
                                                                                      Reactions 21


   5.      Mix the flask with a quick but gentle swirling motion. Be sure to cover the entire
           glass surface evenly while stirring.
   6.      Continue swirling until the silver mirror forms.
   7.      IMMEDIATELY pour out the remaining solution down the drain and rinse the silver
           flask with water. Clean with unconcentrated HNO3.
Additional Information
   1.      If the mirror does not form, the flask was probably not clean.
   2.      This reaction is potentially explosive. Do not mix Solution B and Solution C until the
           demonstration is performed.
   3.      Metallic silver is formed when silver ions oxidize the aldehyde part of the glucose
           molecule:

                                                                              +
               HC                                                  CON     H 4

                           + 2 A g
                                 (NH 3)2+  H O
                                             2                                 + 2Ag +NH 3+ 3 NH 4
               HCO     H                                      O HCH
               HCO     H                                        HCO     H
               HCO     H                                        HCO     H
                  H                                                H
Disposal
       Excess solutions should be filtered with vacuum filtration allowing the silver to be saved
      (and later made into silver nitrate solution). Excess fluids should be flushed down the sink
      with excess water as to prevent the formation of silver azide.
