                                             Luminol
Purpose
   To demonstrate a chemical reaction that produces energy in the form of light.
Materials
   ring stand / clamp                                  sodium carbonate
   buret clamp                                         luminol
   glass funnel                                        ammonium carbonate anhydrous
   two 1000 mL flasks                                  3% H2O2 (store bought)
   coiled condenser                                    CuSO4 • 5 H2O
   500 mL flask
           Solution A: To 500 mL of distilled water add:
                 4.0 grams of anhydrous sodium carbonate
                 0.2 grams of luminol
                 24 grams of sodium bicarbonate
                 0.42 grams anhydrous ammonium carbonate
                 0.4 grams cupric sulfate pentahydrate
                Stir until all chemicals dissolve and add enough water to make one Liter.
          Solution B: Add 50 mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide with enough distilled water to make
                one Liter. Note: Solution B should be made fresh
Procedure
   1.      Attach a coiled condenser to a rings stand above a 500 mL flask.
   2.      Secure a glass funnel so that it will pour into the condenser.
   3.      Turn off the lights and pour Solutions A and B simultaneously into the glass funnel.
   4.      Verify that the light produced is not accompanied by heat.
Additional Information
   1.      As a substitute for the coiled condenser, clamped tygon tubing coiled about a ring
           stand can be used.
   2.      Variation: wearing gloves, soak a piece of cotton in about 50 mL of Solution A.
           Immerse the cotton in about 50 mL of Solution B and wring out the cotton. In the dark
           the cotton ball will glow and “drip fire.”

   3.      Luminol = 5-amino-2,3-dihydrophthalazine-1,4-diome.
   4.      The active ingredient (glowing) is the aminophthalate ion.
   5.      The chemiluminescent reaction of luminol oxidation is represented by:

Disposal
   Solutions should be placed in proper waste container and labeled.
