   To show the bromination rates for alkenes and alkanes.
Materials
   5% bromine in trichloroethane                          3 Petri dishes
   hexane                                                 dropper

   4.      Observe color changes.
   5.      If no color change is evident after 1 minute, the UV lamp can be used to produce
           bromination of hexane.
Additional Information
