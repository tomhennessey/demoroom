                                         Memory Metal
Purpose
   To illustrate an application of an alloy.
Materials
   memory metal
   500 mL beaker
   hot plate
Procedure
   1.      Show students memory metal on overhead.
   2.      Pull on ends to distort metal.
   3.      Ask students how to get shape back.
   4.      Put metal into warm water (50 C) and observe that shape changes back to original.
   5.      Put reshaped metal on overhead.
Additional Information
   1.      Memory metal is Nitinol (Nickel Titanium Naval Ordinance Laboratory). It contains
           equal number of nickel and titanium atoms. If held in a shape and heated to 500-550
           C it “memorizes” the shape.
   2.      The “memorized” shape can be recovered by heating to 30-80 C.
   3.      Applications include switches, safety valves in showers, some staples, orthodontic
           wires, eyeglasses frames.
