                                     Balloon in a Beaker
Purpose
   To demonstrate the relationship between temperature and volume of a gas.
Materials
   liquid nitrogen and dewar                            100 mL beaker
   balloon                                              asbestos gloves
Procedure
   1.      Blow up a balloon to a volume of about one liter (not crucial, just so that it is
           considerably larger than the beaker).
   2.      Pour liquid nitrogen over the balloon and then pick up the balloon (be careful!) and
           put it in the beaker.
   3.      Notice that the balloon eventually expands and leaves the beaker.
Additional Information
   1.      The larger the difference in volume between the balloon and beaker, the more
           dramatic the demonstration.
Disposal
   The balloon can be thrown away.
