                                           Reactive Metals
Purpose
   To demonstrate reactivity of alkali metals in contact with water.
Materials
   1L beakers                                             Knife
   Sodium, potassium, lithium, requested                  DI water
   metal
                                                          Petri dishes
   Tweezers
                                                          Mineral oil
   phenolphthalein
Notes
   •   Minimize the amount of air exposure of metals. Water molecules in the air might start the
       reaction.
   •   Make sure to clean the tweezers and knife with DI water and dip them in mineral oil to
       prevent any contaminants from starting a reaction.
   •   Cut small pieces unless otherwise authorized.
Procedure
   1.      Place the beaker(s) out on the lecture hall, fill them up with DI water and place a
           sheet of filter paper on top of the water so that it floats. The professors may do this
           step themselves.
   2.      Instructor will carefully drop the metals onto the filter paper. The purpose of the filter paper
           is to slow down the reaction by slowing down the hydration of the metal molecules and the
           removal of the coating of mineral oil. This slow reaction will also allow the metals to burn
           their respective colors, similar to flame tests.
   3.      The reaction of pure alkali metals with water makes their respective hydroxides. The
           addition of phenolphthalein will demonstrate this.
Additional Information/Disposal
1.     Water can go down the sink, neutralize if it is too basic.
2.     Any unused metals go back into a container in the metals cabinet.
