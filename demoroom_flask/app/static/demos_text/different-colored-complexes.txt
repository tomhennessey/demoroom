                              Different Colored Complexes
Purpose
   To demonstrate that different metal ions exhibit different colors in a coordination complex.
Materials
   0.1 M solutions of Cu2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Ti2+, Ni2+ Zn2+
   Lecture glasses
Procedure
1.     Add 100 mL of each of the solutions to the lecture glasses and discuss the relative colors.
                             Notice that Mn2+ and Zn2+ appear relatively colorless. Why?
Additional Information
1.     It may also be worthwhile to have solutions of Fe3+ and Cu+ to demonstrate the different
       charges on the same metal give rise to different colored complexes.
Disposal
   Solutions can be reused.
