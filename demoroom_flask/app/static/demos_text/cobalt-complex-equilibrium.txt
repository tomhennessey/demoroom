                                Cobalt Complex Equilibrium
                         Temperature and Concentration Effects:
Purpose
   To demonstrate the shift in equilibrium caused by a change of temperature and a change in
   concentration.
Materials
   0.4 M CoCl2 (5.2g/100 mL H2O)                        hot plate
   0.2 M CoCl2 (2.6g/100 mL H2O)                        ice bath
    0.1 M AgNO3 (1.7g/100 mL H2O)                       2 Deep Petri dishes
   concentrated. HCl                                    distilled water
   250 mL beaker                                        dropper (2)
   100 mL beakers (4)
Procedure
 Temperature effects
   I.      Place 100 mL 0.4 M CoCl2 in 250 mL beaker
   II.     Heat the solution in a flask until it turns blue.
   III.    Fill a large test tube with the blue solution.
   IV.     Immerse lower half of tube in an ice-salt bath (-18 C).
   V.      Note the bottom half of solution turns pink.
 Concentration Effects
   1. Place 20 mL 0.2 M CoCl2 in 100 mL beaker. Add 40 mL conc HCl. Note blue color.
   2. Place 2 Deep Petri dishes on overhead projector. Add CoCl2 solution from 1 to each.
           a. To Petri #1 add distilled water until color changes to clear.
           b. To Petri #2 add AgNO3 drop wise until precipitate forms.
                         Note pink color of solution.
Additional Information
   1. The equilibrium is
        heat + [Co(H2O)6]2+(aq) + 4 Cl−(aq) ⇌ [CoCl4]2−(aq) + 6 H2O(l)
                 pink                             blue
                                                                               Equilibrium 3


   2. Temperature effects
          a. Heat causes shift in equilibrium to products
          b. Cooling shifts equilibrium to reactants
   3. Concentration effects
         a. Excess Cl− causes formation of a more blue complex (tetrachlorocobalt (II))
         b. excess H2O shifts equilibrium to pink complex (hexaaquocobalt (II))
         c. Silver nitrate removes Cl− (forming Ag Cl) causing equilibrium to shift toward the
         pink complex.
Disposal
   Solutions should be placed in properly labeled waste container with UI# 96482.
