                                      Disappearing Ink
Purpose
   To demonstrate an example of neutralization between an acid and base.
Materials
   125 mL Erlenmeyer Flask                           0.1 M sodium hydroxide
   Rubber stopper                                    Dropper
   50 mL ethyl alcohol                               White cotton shirt
   Thymolphthalein indicator
Procedure
   1. Pour 50 mL of the ethyl alcohol in the 125 mL flask
   2. Add 2-3 droppers ful (2-3 mL) of Thymolphthalein indicator to the ethyl alcohol
   3. Add about 2 drops sodium hydroxide, or just enough so the solution turns a dark blue
       color.
   4. Place the rubber stopper in the flask while solution is being stored – the solution will
       neutralize in the presence of carbon dioxide in the air
   5. Splash some of the solution onto the white cotton shirt
   6. Wait a few seconds – the blue stain will disappear (the residue will come off in the wash)
Additional Information
   1. The solution can be used on paper, however it may be necessary to spray with ammonia
       or vinegar to cause the color to disappear.
   2. The sodium hydroxide causes the blue color. When on the shirt, the carbon dioxide in the
       air reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which in turn reacts with the sodium
       hydroxide to neutralize.
   3. Thymolphthalein is colorless in acid, blue in base.
Disposal
   Extra solution can be stored, or poured down the drain with excess water. The cotton t-shirt
   can be washed causing the residue to be cleaned off.
