                                       Chemical Sunset
Purpose
   To illustrate the formation of a colloid and show how colloids diffract light.
Materials
   beaker or Petri dish to cover template               concentrated HCl
   scenic template for overhead                         10 mL graduated cylinder
   0.03 M Na2S2O3                                       stirring rod
Procedure
   1.      Dissolve 3.5 g Na2S2O3 • 5 H2O in 500 mL water.
   2.      Place scenic template on overhead projector (the demo room has the templates).
   3.      Place beaker or Petri dish over scenic template.
   4.      Add enough Na2S2O3 to cover bottom of the container.
   5.      Add about 5 mL concentrated HCl and quickly stir the solution.
   6.      Dim lights and observe color changes.
Additional Information
   1.      Reactions are:
                  2 H+ + S2O32− → H2S2O3
                  H2S2O3 → H2SO3 + colloidal sulfur.
   2.      Sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate is also known as hypo. It is used in photography
           development.
   3.      Formation of colloidal sulfur should take 25-30 seconds.
Questions for the Students
   1.      How is a colloid different than a solution?
Disposal
   Solutions should be placed in properly labeled waste containers.
