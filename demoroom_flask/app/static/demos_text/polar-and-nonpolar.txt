                                       Polar–Non Polar
Purpose
   To demonstrate the change in solubility of alcohols in water as the chain length increases.
Materials
   ethanol                                           4 Petri dishes
   n-butanol                                         wash bottle (water)
   t-butanol                                         4 disposable pipets
   heptanol                                          octanol/water bottle (in prep room, prepared
   non-polar dye (Sudan)                                and colored)
Procedure
   1.      Place 4 Petri dishes on the overhead.
   2.      Cover the bottom of all the Petri dishes with water.
   3.      Add a few drops of each alcohol separately to a Petri dish.
   4.      Observe the solubility.
   5.      Ask students to predict octanol and water solubility. Show them the prepared bottle
           of octanol/water from the prep room.
Additional Information
1.     As alcohols become more nonpolar, solubility decreases in water.
2.     Sudan dye works well on skin – handle it carefully. If you “dye” yourself a little acetone
       will reduce the intensity.
Disposal
       Solutions containing octanol, n-butanol, t-butanol and heptanol should be placed in a
       properly labeled waste container.
