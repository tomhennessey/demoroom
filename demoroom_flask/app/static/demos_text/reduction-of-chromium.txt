                                The Reduction of Chromium
Purpose
   To demonstrate two oxidation states of chromium, generate heat, and produce a gel by
   mixing two liquids.
Materials
   Two 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks                           0.5M K2Cr2O7
   Tall form beaker                                       4M NaHSO3
   Two 50 mL graduated cylinders                          Hot plate
Procedure
   1. Prepare solution 0.5M K2Cr2O7. Dissolve 14.7g of potassium dichromate in 100 mL of
       warm distilled water.
   2. Prepare solution 4M NaHSO3. Dissolve 41.6g of sodium bisulfite in 100 mL of warm
       distilled water.
   3. Place 50 mL of K2Cr2O7 solution in the beaker and add an equal amount of NaHSO3
       solution to the beaker.
   4. The mixture will immediately turn a very dark green, generating quite a bit of heat, and
       after about 20-30 seconds it will become a gel and lighten.
Additional Information
   1. More than one reaction appears to occur in this system. The most significant reaction
       involves the reduction of chromium and the subsequent formation of hydrated hydroxide:
   2. It is likely the ions of the sulfate and sodium are incorporated in the gel to form an alum
       [KCr(SO4)2].
   3. This demonstration is a fine introduction to an oxidation-reduction reactions unit.
Disposal
   Remaining solution/solid should be placed in a properly labeled waste container. A spatula
   may be necessary to scoop out the gel.
