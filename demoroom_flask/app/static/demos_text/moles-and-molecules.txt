                                   Moles and Molecules
Purpose
   To compare the amounts of several substances using moles and number of molecules.
Materials
   four 500 mL beakers                                  sulfur
   sugar                                                water
Procedure
   Preparation
       1.     Place the following in labeled separate beakers:
              a. 18 mL water → 1 mol H2O
              b. 342 g sugar → 1 mol sugar
              c. 256 g sulfur → 1 mol sulfur
              d. 342 mL water → 342 g H2O
Presentation
       1.     Show the students the beakers each containing 1 mole.
                      a. Note differences in mass and volume.
                      b. Note sameness in number of molecules (6.022 × 1023 in each case).
       2.     Now use beaker containing sugar and one containing 342 g H2O.
                      a. Note same mass.
                      b. Note different number of molecules.
Additional Information
       1.     In the beakers containing the same mass the sugar contains 6.022 × 1023
              molecules while the water contains 19 (6.022 × 1023) = 1.14 × 1025 molecules
              of water.
Questions for the Students
       1.     Write formulas for each substance.
       2.     In the first comparison why are the mass and volume so different if the number of
              molecules are the same?
       3.     In the second comparison how many molecules of water are in the beaker?
                                                                                Stoichiometry 3


        4.     What is the ratio of molecules in the sugar beaker to molecules in the water
               beaker? How does this compare to the ratio of moles from sugar to water?
Disposal
   Chemicals can be reused for the demo in the future.
