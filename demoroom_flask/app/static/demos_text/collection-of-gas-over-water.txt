                            Collection of Gas over Water
Purpose
To qualitatively observe the formation of O2 (g) product from a classic chemical reaction
Materials
Pan and gas hose apparatus                        Stopper
Jar (500 mL)                                      Side arm flask (500 mL)
Wooden splint                                     Water
Matches                                           Potassium Iodide (Saturated 20 mL)
Glass square                                      Hydrogen Peroxide (3% store-bought
                                                  solution 30 mL
Preparation
    1. Fill the assembled pan and hose apparatus with water until the water level is ~1
       cm above the glass tube in the middle of the apparatus.
    2. Completely fill the 500 mL jar with water, and using the glass square, invert the
       jar into the pan full of water. Carefully move the jar under the water and place the
       jar over the glass tube in the middle without releasing any water from the jar.
    3. Attach the gas hose to the side arm flask.
Procedure
    1. Pour 20 mL of KI into the side arm flask.
    2. Pour 30 mL of H2O2 into the side arm flask and immediately stopper the flask.
    3. Allow the reaction to completely react. The jar will be filling with oxygen gas.
    4. Light the end of the wooden splint on fire.
    5. When the reaction is complete, remove the jar from the water (spilling out any
       excess water. Blow the wooden splint out and immediately insert it into the jar to
       detect the presence of oxygen. The splint should reignite in the presence of
       oxygen.
Disposal
   All contents of the experiment can be disposed of down the drain with plenty of water.
                                                                                          Gases 29
