                                   Oscillating Clock Reaction
Purpose
   To demonstrate the classic Belousov-Zhabotinsky Reaction illustrating an oscillating reaction
   mechanism.
Materials
   2 liter beaker                                     potassium bromate
   3 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks                         Potassium bromide
   magnetic stirrer / bar                             malonic acid
   0.1% ferroin indicator                             cerium (IV) ammonium nitrate
Procedure
   Preparation
        1.      Solution A. In a 500 mL flask, dissolve 19 grams of potassium bromate in 500
                mL of distilled water. This solution is 0.23 M.
        2.      Solution B. In a 500 mL flask, dissolve 16 grams of malonic acid and 3.5 grams
                of potassium bromide in 500 mL of distilled water. This solution is 0.31 M
                malonic acid and 0.059 M KBr.
        3.      Solution C. In a 500 mL flask, dissolve 5.3 grams of cerium (IV) ammonium
                nitrate in 500 mL of 2.7 M sulfuric acid. This solution is 0.019 M.
        4.      Set the 2 liter beaker on the magnetic stirrer.
   Presentation
        1.     Pour Solution A and Solution B into the beaker and adjust the stirrer to produce a
               vortex in the solution.
        3.     Add Solution C and 30-35 mL of ferroin. The solution will become amber.
        4.     After about one minute, the color of the solution will change from amber to
               yellow, then green, and finally red. The color will return to amber and repeat
               itself many times (20+).
Additional Information
   1.       2.7 M sulfuric acid (pour 75 mL of 18 M sulfuric acid into 250 mL of distilled water
            and dilute the resulting solution to 500 mL with distilled water).
   2.       The overall reaction occurring in this demonstration is the cerium-catalyzed oxidation
            of malonic acid by bromate ions in diluted sulfuric acid. The bromate ions are
                                                                                      Reactions 17


           reduced to bromide ions, while the malonic acid is oxidized to carbon dioxide and
           water. The reaction can be represented by the equation:
                       3 CH2(CO2H)2 + 4 BrO3− → 4 Br- + 9 CO2 + 6 H2O
   3.      The reaction mechanism involves two different processes. Process A involves ions,
           and the steps are two-electron transfers. Process B involves radicals and one-electron
           transfers. Which process is dominant at a particular time is determined by the
           bromide ion concentration.
   4.      Process A occurs when the bromide ion concentration rises above a certain critical
           level, while Process B dominates when the bromide ion concentration falls below a
           certain level.
   5.      Oscillations occur because Process A consumes bromide ions and thus leads to the
           conditions which favor Process B. Process B liberates bromide ions, which return the
           reaction to control by Process A.
   6.      It is apparent that much is to be learned to fully understand the activities within the
           solution. Many oscillations infer much competition for the available ions.
Disposal
   Solutions should be placed in properly labeled waste container.
