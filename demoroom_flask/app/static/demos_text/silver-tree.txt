                                         Silver Tree
Purpose
   To demonstrate the basic properties of an electrochemical cell.
Materials
   250 to 600 mL beaker                                0.1 M AgNO3
   copper wire
Procedure
                                                                   Electrochemistry 3


1.     Bend the copper wire into desired shape (tree, conical helix, etc.).
2.     Place in beaker of appropriate size or hang from a stir rod placed across the top.
3.     Pour the AgNO3 solution into the beaker until the tree is covered.
4.     Silver crystals will form on the wire after several minutes, and the solution will start to
       turn blue. More crystals will form and give a “fuzzy” appearance over the course of the
       lecture.
Additional Information
1.              The half-reactions are:
                                                                             ℰ(V)
                Ag+ + e− → Ag                                  0.80
                Cu2+ + 2 e− → Cu                      0.34
                The overall reaction is:
                Cu(s) + 2 Ag+ → Cu2+ + Ag(s)          ℰcell = 0.46V
2.     More concentrated solutions of AgNO3 can be used for a more dramatic effect, however
       AgNO3 is expensive and hard to dispose of.
