                               Organic Exothermic Reaction
Purpose
   To demonstrate that a strong oxidizing agent, combined with a combustible material, will
   burst into flame.
Materials
   asbestos pad                                      potassium chlorate
   spatula                                           granulated sugar
   crucible                                          sulfuric acid
Procedure
   1.      With a spatula, carefully mix 6.0 grams of potassium chlorate with 2.0 grams of
           granulated sugar in a crucible. If the amounts are doubled, the reaction is more
           impressive.
   2.      Pile the mixture in the middle of the asbestos pad.
   3.      Make a small depression in the top of the pile with the spatula.
   4.      Add about 0.5 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid into the depression and stand back
           immediately.
   5.      The reaction begins quickly, evolving smoke after 1-3 seconds, and then the pile will
           burst into a purplish flame.
Additional Information
   1.      Potassium chlorate is the strong oxidizing agent. Do not store the mixture of KClO3
           and sugar for long periods of time.
   2.      Sulfuric acid is a powerful dehydrating agent. Thus, handle it with great care. Spills
           can be neutralized with sodium bicarbonate.
Disposal
   Remaining solid should be placed in properly labeled solid waste container.
