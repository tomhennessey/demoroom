                    Limiting Reagent (Baking Soda with Vinegar)
Purpose
      To demonstrate the concept of limiting reactants
Materials
      Vinegar                                        500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks
      Baking Soda                                    Balloons
Procedure
   1. Pour 150 mL of vinegar into each of the Erlenmeyer flasks.
   2. Loosen the balloons that are going to be used by stretching them out (this will make it
      easier for the balloons to expand during the reaction).
   3. Place the following amounts of baking soda into the balloons and then attach the balloons
      to the appropriate flask without letting the baking soda spill into the vinegar.

   4. Dump the baking soda into flask 1.
   5. Ask the students what is going to happen when you dump the baking soda into flask 2.
   6. Dump the baking soda into flask 2. You may need to support the balloon until the
      reaction completes.

   7. Repeat this process for the other three flasks.
   8. For flasks 3-5, the reaction will result in an overflow of liquid into the balloon. After the
       most vigorous portion of the reaction, gently hold up the balloon and allow the contents
       to drain back into the reaction flask.
Alternate
      This demo can be performed using Mg and HCl in place of vinegar/baking soda, however
   the HCl can bubble over into the balloon, forming holes in the latex and causing the acid to
   spill out.
Discussion
       This demonstration can be used to illustrate the concept of limiting reagents.
   When vinegar (a dilute solution of acetic acid: CH3COOH) and baking soda (NaHCO3) react,
   carbon dioxide, a gas, is produced:
                    NaHCO3 (aq) + CH3COOH(aq) â†’ CO2 (g) + H2O(l) + CH3COONa(aq)
               (baking soda)       (vinegar)
         In the first two flasks the limiting reagent is the baking soda, so as you add more baking
   soda the balloon gets bigger. The third flask contains a 1:1 molar ratio of vinegar and baking
   soda. In the fourth and fifth flasks the limiting reagent is now the vinegar, so the balloons
   remain the size as the balloon on the third flask.
Disposal
    All solutions can be poured down the drain with excess water and balloons can be thrown
   away.
