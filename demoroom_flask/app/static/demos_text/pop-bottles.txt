                                          “Pop” Bottles
Purpose
   To demonstrate an exothermic reaction between hydrogen and oxygen.
Materials
   hydrogen gas                                        oxygen gas
   soda bottles wrapped in duct tape                   bunsen burner
   rubber stoppers                                     matches
Procedure
   1.     The bottles are filled via water displacement. Fill the bottle with water.
   2.     Fill the bottle with 2 parts hydrogen gas, one part oxygen gas. Use rubber stoppers to
          cap the bottles before removing them from the water container.
   3.     Shake the stoppered bottle gently to determine if there is any water in the bottle. If
          there is, the bottle will not work and must be made over again.
   4.     To ignite, remove the rubber stopper and place the mouth of the bottle by the flame of
          the bunsen burner.
Additional Information
   1.     A small kickback can be expected from the bottles. Therefore do not hold the bottle
          at the base.
   2.     For a larger effect, you can use a 2 L bottle covered in duct tape. A small open space
          from the top is used as a “window” when filling the bottle. This bottle can be
          released as it is inserted into the flame to add drama and illustrate the kickback from
          the explosion.
Question for the Students
1.     Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction.
