                                        Liquid Nitrogen
Purpose
    To demonstrate the effects of the loss of elasticity for a variety of substances.
Materials
    liquid nitrogen                                        one liter beaker
    rubber ball                                            flowers
    mercury                                                crackers
    banana                                                 Dewar
    asbestos gloves                                        board and nail
Procedure
    1.      Bounce a rubber ball on the floor. Pour out some of the liquid nitrogen from the
            Dewar into a one liter beaker. Place ball into the beaker. Freeze the ball and then
            throw it against a concrete surface.
    2.      Dip a flower into the nitrogen. Break it against the demonstration table.
    3.      Dip crackers into the nitrogen. Allow students to chew the crackers. Watch the
            “smoke” exit their mouths.
    4.      Dip a peeled banana into the dewar of nitrogen. After freezing it completely use it to
            pound a nail into a piece of board.
Additional Information
1.      Variation: Mercury may be used instead of a banana. It is toxic. Pour about 100 mL of
        mercury into a paper cup. Dip the cup into the nitrogen, adding a popsicle stick into the
        mercury. After freezing, peel the paper away and use the “mercury hammer” to drive a
        nail into a piece of board.
2.      A variation involves a carbon dioxide balloon attached to a large test tube. Dip the test
        tube into the liquid nitrogen. The carbon dioxide will sublimate from the balloon into the
        test tube.
Disposal
Things that shatter can be thrown away. Extra liquid nitrogen can be used for other demos or
allowed to dissipate.
