Purpose
   A colorful oscillating reaction, made by the oxidation/reduction of indigo carmine.
Materials
   NaOH                                               4 L beaker
   Glucose                                            12 x 250 Erlenmeyer flasks with screw lid
   Indigo carmine
Procedure
   1. For solution A: make 1.25 NaOH (60g NaOH in 1.2 L of DI H2O)
   2. For solution B: make 0.166 M glucose (36g Glucose in 1.2 L of DI H2O)
   3. About 15 minutes before the show, add 0.6 g of indigo carmine to solution A (NaOH
       solution)
   4. Pour both solutions into a 4 L beaker, the solution should be green
   5. Pour 200 mL of the solution into each of the 250 mL flasks and stopper them
   6. Allow to sit for a few minutes and the solutions will turn red.
   7. For presentation, set flasks out across the lecture hall in a row, shake each of the flasks to
       turn them green, attempt to get all the flasks to be green. Be careful: the solution will turn
       yellow then red quickly!
Disposal
   Solution can be poured down the drain with excess water.
                                                                                  Reactions: More 67
