                                An Endothermic Reaction
Purpose
To demonstrate an endothermic reaction by combining two solids.
Materials
250 mL beaker                                       hydrated barium hydroxide
wooden splint                                       ammonium thiocyanate
wooden board
Procedure
   1. Place about 20 grams of Ba(OH)2 8 H2O crystals in a 250 mL beaker.
   2. Add 10 grams of ammonium thiocyanate to the beaker.
   3. Stir the two solids together with a wooden splint.
   4. Place a small pool of water on a piece of board. Place the beaker on the pool of water.
   5. After 2-3 minutes, the beaker will freeze to the board.
Additional Information
   1. Ammonium chloride (7.0 grams) or ammonium nitrate (10 grams) may replace the
       ammonium thiocyanate.
   2. Ba(OH)2 8 H2O + 2 NH4SCN Ba(SCN)2 + 2 NH3 + 10 H2O
   3. A variation involves adding about 10-15 grams of ammonium nitrate to 100 mL of water.
       The temperature will drop significantly.
Disposal
       Excess solutions/solids should be placed in a properly labeled waste container with UI#
205437.
