                            Salting Out of Ethanol and Water
Purpose
   To introduce or illustrate the concept of intermolecular forces via salting out, or the
   separation of an organic phase from an aqueous phase by the addition of a salt.
Materials
   DI Water                                               Two large test tubes with stoppers
   Ethanol                                                1M HCl
   Bromothymol blue indicator                             Potassium carbonate
Procedure
   1. To the first test tube, add 10mL of Ethanol, 10mL of DI water, 5 drops of bromothymol
       blue indicator, and 1 drop of 1M HCl.
   2. Add 3g Potassium carbonate to the second test tube.
   3. Pour the contents of the first test tube into the second. Stopper and shake the tube. The
       solution should turn blue and separate into two phases: a colorless aqueous and blue
       organic phase.
Questions for Students
   1. Which phase is water, which is alcohol? Why?
   2. Is the separation of water and alcohol complete?
   3. Could other liquid pairs or salts be used?
   4. Could a dye be found that would wind up in the water rich phase? Why?
Safety
   Hydrochloric acid is corrosive to body tissue, so be sure to wear protective equipment.
Disposal
   End mixture can be disposed of down the drain with excess water.
