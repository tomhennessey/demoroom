                                   The Activated Complex
Purpose
   To demonstrate the observation of an activated complex and its action.
Materials
        hot water bath                                 hydrogen peroxide
        600 mL beaker                                  potassium sodium tartrate
        cobalt (II) chloride
   Solution A: Sodium potassium tartrate: 12 grams KNaC4H4O6â€¢4 H2O per 200 mL of water.
   Solution B: Hydrogen peroxide: Use a 6% solution. Add 40 mL of 30% H2O2 per 200 mL of
       solution.
Procedure
   1.      Place 200 mL of Solution A in a 600 mL beaker.
   2.      Warm the solution gently to about 70 C on a hot plate.
   3.      Add 80 mL of Solution B to the beaker.
   4.      Add cobalt (II) chloride crystals to the solution.
   5.      A vigorous reaction will occur. Note the appearance of the green activated complex
           and the extensive bubbling.
Additional Information
   1.      This reaction involves the oxidation of tartaric acid [HO2CCH(OH)CH(OH)CO2H]
           by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of cobalt (II) chloride catalyst.
   2.      The green color is due to the formation of a cobalt-tartrate activated complex.
   3.      Not that the original catalyst, cobalt (II) chloride is pink. As the tartrate is oxidized,
           the activated complex is broken down to the original catalyst, and the pink color
           returns.
   4.      Oxygen and CO2 gases are produced. Oxalic acid (HO2CCO2H) is also produced.
   5.      Do not exceed 70 C or the solution may froth and overflow.
   6.      This demonstration also shows the relationship between temperature and reaction rate.
           Typically, an initial temperature of 50, 60 or 70 C will produce a reaction time of 200,
           90, or 40 seconds, respectively.
   7.      As a general rule, increasing the temperature of reaction by 10 C will double the rate
           of reaction.
                                                                        Kinetics/Thermodynamics 1


Disposal
       Solutions/solids should be placed in a properly labeled waste container with UI# 96493.
