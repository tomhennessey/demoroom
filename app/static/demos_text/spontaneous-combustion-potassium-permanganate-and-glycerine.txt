       Spontaneous Combustion Potassium Permanganate and Glycerine
Purpose
   To demonstrate spontaneous combustion and the effect of increased surface area on the rate
   of a chemical reaction.
Materials
   100 mL mortar and pestle                          potassium permanganate
   spatula                                           glycerine
   2 droppers
Procedure
   1.      Using a mortar and pestle, slowly grind another 5.0 grams of KMnO4 to a fine
           powder. Place the protective shield under the mortar on the bench for protection.
   2.      With a spatula, form a depression in the center of the pile.
   3.      With a dropper, add about 5 drops of glycerine into the depression of the pile.
   4.      After a few seconds, a white puff of smoke is produced, followed by crackling,
           sparking and a purplish flame.
   5.      Combustion will continue until the glycerine is consumed.
   6.      The product is a grayish solid with green regions.
Additional Information
   1.      The more finely ground crystals, the faster the reaction occurs.
   2.      Handle the potassium permanganate with great care. Explosions will occur if it comes
           into contact with organic material.
   3.      14 KMnO4 (s) + 4 C3H5(OH)3 (l) 7 K2CO3 (s) + 7 Mn2O3 (s) + 5 CO2 (g) + 16 H2O
           (g)
   4.      Manganese oxide is black and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is white. Other products
           must be formed. Addition of water yields a dark greenish solution and an insoluble
           solid. The green color may be due to potassium manganate (K2MnO4) and the dark
           insoluble solid contains Mn2O3 and/or MnO2.
   5.      In the event the fire becomes too large, douse with water or sand.
Disposal
   The solid can be placed in a properly labeled solid waste container.
