                                       How Sweet It Is!
                                 Rainbow Density Column
Purpose
   To demonstrate how the density of an aqueous sugar solution changes with concentration.
Materials
   300 g sucrose                                      separatory funnel, 250 mL
   food coloring                                      rubber tubing
   balance                                            graduated cylinder
   7 beakers or cups                                  1000 mL tall cylinder
   stirring rods                                      500 mL graduated cylinder
Procedure
   1.      Prepare seven solutions of sugar water according to the table given below. Make the
           colored water solutions first, adjusting the colors to the desired shade for clear
           distinction between them before adding the sugar. Measure 140 mL of water of each
           color into a beaker. Then dissolve the sugar in the colored water.

   1.     Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram below. The rubber tubing must be very
          near the bottom of the 1000 mL cylinder during the addition of the solutions.
   2.     Add the red colored sugar solution to the separatory funnel with the stopcock closed.
   3.     Partially open the stopcock valve while angling the tubing upward in order to fill the
          tubing completely with red solution. Place the hose in the 1 L cylinder and close the
          valve on the separatory funnel just before all the red solution has drained from the
          separatory funnel. It is very important that the hose is completely filled or the
          solutions will not flow into the hydrometer as the other colors are added.
   4.     Now add the orange solution to the separatory funnel. Again, close the stopcock jsut
          before all the orange solution has drained from the separatory funnel.
   5.     Add each of the remaining solutions in order of increasing concentration in the same
          way.
   6.     Carefully withdraw the tubing and remove the separtatory funnel from the column.
Additional Information
   1.      The solutions can be prepared using a microwave to warm the water for sugar
           dissolution. This can be done the day before the demonstration. The solutions can be
           transported in foam cups with lids.
   2.      The addition of each solution should be made slowly so distinct layers can be seen.
   3.      The distinct layers are visible for at least 24 hours if the column remains undisturbed.
   4.      Students can construct their own columns in 10 mL graduated cylinders. Use Beral
           pipets and carefully add 1 mL increments progressing from the most dense solution
           (violet) to the least dense solution (red).

Disposal
   Solutions should be poured down the drain with excess water.
