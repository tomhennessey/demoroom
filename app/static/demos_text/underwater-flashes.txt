                                    Underwater Flashes
Purpose
   To show the dramatic exothermic reaction between chlorine and acetylene gases.
Materials
   18 × 150 test tube                                calcium carbide (2 or 3 pieces)
   two hole stopper (00)                             KMnO4 (0.5 g)
   glass tubing (3 feet)                             concentrated HCl
   1 mL microtip, or long stem Beral pipet           ring stand
   test tube clamp                                   1000 mL hydrometer
Procedure
   1. Bend the glass tubing and insert it into the rubber stopper, along with the pipet.
       Assemble the apparatus as shown in the diagram below:
   2.       Place the KMnO4 in the test tube. Fill the Beral pipet with concentrated HCl and
            place the assembly in the test tube, being careful not to squeeze the pipet bulb.
   3.      Fill the hydrometer with water.
   4.      To begin generating chlorine gas squeeze several drops of HCl from the pipet onto
           the KMnO4. The chlorine gas will be delivered into the hydrometer and bubbles
           should appear. Be careful to generate only enough chlorine to produce the
           reaction.
   5.      Add 2 or 3 pieces of calcium carbide to the hydrometer and observe the flashes which
           are produced when the chlorine and acetylene react. Additional HCl may be added to
           generate enough chlorine gas to continue the reaction.
Additional Information
   1.      Acetylene gas is produced by the reaction CaC2 + 2 H2O C2H2 + Ca(OH)2.
   2.      The chlorine gas is generated by the following reaction:
                       2 MnO4−1 + 16 H+ + 10 Cl−1 → 5 Cl2 + 2 Mn2+ + 8 H2O
                                                                        Reactions: Exothermic 43


   3.       The sparks result from the exothermic addition of chlorine across the triple bond.
            Some evidence suggests that the product is actually a chlorinated polymer of
            acetylene.
