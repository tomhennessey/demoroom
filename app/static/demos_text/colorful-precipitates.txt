                                 Colorful Precipitates
Purpose
   To demonstrate the predictability of double replacement reactions, the use of
   solubility rules, and to provide an opportunity for students to write out formulas, total
   ionic and net ionic equations.
Materials

   Test tube rack                                  Lead (II) nitrate
   Nickel (II) chloride                            Barium chloride
   Potassium iodide                                Copper (II) chloride
   Sodium sulfate                                  Potassium chloride
   Sodium nitrate                                  Silver nitrate

Procedure
   1. Prepare 0.1 M solutions of each of the listed reagents.
   2. Label 12 test tubes ad follows:
       1- AgNO3                      5- Pb(NO3)2                       9- BaCl2
       2- K2Cr2O7                    6- KI                             10- Na2SO4
       3- NiCl2                      7- NaNO3                          11- CuCl2
       4- Na2CO3                     8- KCl                            12- Na2CO3
   3. Fill each test tube one third full of its solution
   4. Pour the contents of test tube #1 into #2. Ask students to make observations, write
       out an ionic equation for the reaction, and name the precipitate.
   5. Mix the remaining test tubes as follows, having the same patterns as in #4 above:
           a. Test tube #3 into test tube #4
           b. Test tube #5 into test tube #6
           c. Test tube #7 into test tube #8
           d. Test tube #9 into test tube #10
           e. Test tube #11 into test tube #12
Additional Information
   1. Silver nitrate and ammonium thiocyanate produce a brown precipitate, silver
       thiocyanate.
           Ag+ + NO3- + 2 K+ + Cr2O72- → Ag2Cr2O7 (s) + 2 K+ + NO3-
                                                                                   Stoichiometry 1


                 (all ions are aqueous)     (spectator ions are ions that do not enter the rxn
                                            like K+ and NO3-)
    2. Nickel chloride and sodium carbonate produce the pale blue precipitate, nickel
        carbonate
             Ni2+ + 2 Cl- + 2 Na+ + CO32- → NiCO3 (s) + 2 Cl- + 2 Na+
    3. Lead nitrate and potassium iodide produce the yellow precipitate, lead iodide.
             Pb2+ + 2 NO3- + 2 K+ +2 I- → PbI2 (s) + 2 NO3- + 2 K+
    4. Sodium nitrate and potassium chloride produce no reaction.
             Na+ + NO3- + K+ + Cl- → N.R.
    5. Barium chloride and sodium sulfate produce the white precipitate, barium sulfate.
             Ba2+ + 2 Cl- +2 Na+ +SO42- → BaSO4 (s) + 2 Cl- + 2 Na+
    6. Copper (II) chloride and sodium carbonate produce the pale blue precipitate,
        copper (II) carbonate.
             Cu2+ + 2 Cl- + 2 Na+ + CO32- → CuCO3 (s) + 2 Cl- + 2 Na+
Questions for the Students
    1. Identify the precipitate.
    2. Write a balanced equation for the reaction.
    3. Write the net ionic equation for the reaction.
Disposal
    Solutions should be placed in appropriately labeled waste containers, taking care to
    get all of the precipitates into the waste container. Use UI# 205438.
