                                            Flame Tests
Purpose
   To illustrate the colors associated with various metal salts and relate this to electrons
   changing levels.
Materials
   several evaporating dishes                         methanol in wash bottle
   nitrate (or chloride) salts of metals              water in wash bottle
       (Li, Sr, Cu, Ba, K, Na)                        matches
   Glass stirring rods
Procedure
   1.           Place a quarter-sized amount of each salt in a separate evaporating dish.
   2.           Add small amount of water to just begin dissolution.
   3.           Add about 10 mL of methanol using wash bottle.
   4.           Stir each with separate stirring rod.
   5.           Light each with match and dim lights.
Additional Information
   1. The amount of methanol will determine how long these burn. Be careful to plan for this.
   2. This demonstration can be done interactively as “Name this ion.”
   3. Initially the methanol will burn as blue to colorless. Stirring may be needed to produce
       color.
Disposal
   Remaining solids/solutions should be placed in properly labeled waste containers with UI#
100965.
