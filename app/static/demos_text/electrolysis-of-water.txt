                                     Electrolysis of Water
Purpose
   To show the electrolysis of water, the ratio of H2 and O2 produced and the pH of the
   solutions at the electrodes.
Materials
   electrolysis apparatus or ring stand                  0.1 M K2SO4 or Na2SO4
   electric leads                                        universal indicator
   power source (battery)
Procedure
1.     Set-up the electrolysis apparatus as shown:
   2.      Add solution to apparatus. Be sure to open stopcocks before filling. Fill to remove
           all the bubbles from both side columns. Close stopcocks.
   3.      Be sure that the central reservoir is not completely full.
   4.      Add several drops of universal indicator.
   5.      Attach leads to power source. Allow the apparatus to run for 10-15 minutes to
           produce plenty of H2 and O2 and show indicator changes.
                                                                                      Reactions 5


Additional Information
   1.      H2 and O2 gases may be collected in inverted test tubes. The H2 can be ignited with a
           burning splint to produce a whistling sound. If a glowing splint is inserted into the O2
           tube, it will burst into flame.
   2.      The reactions are:
               4 H2O + 4 e−         → 2 H2 +     4 OH−
               2 H2O                → O2    +    4 H+ +     4 e−
           __________________________________________________
               6 H2O                → 2 H2 +     O2     +   4 (H++ OH−)
           Net
               2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2
Questions for the Students
   1.      What are the two gases?
   2.      Which gas is at which electrode?
   3.      Write a balanced equation for electrolysis of water.
Disposal
      The solution in the apparatus can be re-used. Once the demo is complete, return the
      solution to the original container.
      Solution in container may grow mold. If this happens, simply make a fresh batch of the
      solution.
