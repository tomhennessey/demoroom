                                       Colorful Balloons
Purpose
   To illustrate the colors associated with various metal salts with a colorful balloon explosion.
Materials
   Balloon                                                 H2 Gas
   Funnel                                                  String
   Petri Dish                                              Candle on a stick
   Methanol                                                Matches
   Chloride or Nitrate Salt of Li, Sr, Cu,
   Ba, K or Na
Procedure
   1.  Place a small amount of salt in petri dish
   2.  Mix salt with Methanol
   3.  Place funnel in balloon opening, and add the Methanol/salt solution to balloon
   4.  Being sure not to spill the solution, fill balloon with H2 gas
   5.  Tie off balloon and attach to string
   6.  Light candle on the stick and carefully bring to the base of balloon. The balloon will pop,
       igniting the H2 and the Methanol solution which will produce a colored fiery explosion
Additional Information
       1. Colors of the salts will be as follows:
           Sodium – yellow, Lithium - red, Strontium - red, Copper - blue/green, Potassium –
           pale violet, Barium – yellow/green.
Disposal
   Pieces from the balloons can be thrown into the trash.
                                                                                           Gases 31
