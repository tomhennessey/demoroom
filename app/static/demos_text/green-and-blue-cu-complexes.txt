                           Green and Blue Copper Complexes
Purpose
   To demonstrate that different ligands exhibit different colors in a coordination complex.
Materials
   0.2M CuSO4 • 5 H2O solution (50g/L)               Large graduated cylinder
   Concentrated HCl                                  Pipet
   Concentrated ammonia
Procedure
   1. Fill the graduated cylinder about one-fourth with the copper sulfate solution.
   2. Add the HCl until a pale green solution is formed.
   3. Use the pipet to add the ammonia until a deep blue color forms. The deep blue solution
       should sit above the green solution.
Additional Information
   1. The reactions are:
               Cu(H2O)42+(aq) + 4 Cl- ↔ CuCl42-(aq) + 4 H2O (l)
               (pale blue)                (light green)
               CuCl42-(aq) + 4 NH3 ↔ Cu(NH3)42+(aq) + 4 Cl- (aq)
               (light green)           (deep blue)
   2. The tetraaquacopper (II) and tetraaminecopper (II) complexes have a square planar
       structure. The tetrachlorocopper (II) complex has a tetrahedron structure.
Disposal
   Solutions should be placed in properly labeled waste containers with UI# 100947.
