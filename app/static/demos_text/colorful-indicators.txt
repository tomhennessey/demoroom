                                     Colorful Indicators
Purpose
   To demonstrate several reactions with carbon dioxide and indicators that result in a variety of
   color changes.
Materials
   12 demo glasses                                       phenol red indicator
   phenolphthalein indicator                             methyl red indicator
   bromothymol blue indicator                            universal indicator
   sodium hydroxide                                      dry ice (CO2)
   hydrochloric acid                                     insulated gloves
   thymolphthalein indicator
Procedure
1.     Fill each of 12 demo glasses as follows:
           1st pair: add 1 mL of thymolphthalein indicator solution.
           2nd pair: add 1 mL of phenophthalein indicator solution.
           3rd pair: add 1 mL of phenol red indicator solution.
           4th pair: add 1 mL of bromothymol blue indicator solution.
           5th pair: add 1 mL of methyl red indicator solution.
           6th pair: add 1 mL of universal indicator solution.
8.     Add 1 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution to each demo glass. Then dilute each with 100 mL of
       DI H2O.
9.     Wearing gloves, drop a chunk of solid carbon dioxide into one demo glass of each pair
       and note the color changes.
Additional Information
   1. 5.0 M aqueous ammonia may substitute for sodium hydroxide. The pH will not fall low
           enough to change the color of methyl red.

                                                   Original → NaOH → CO2
    Number
       1         thymolphthalein        colorless → blue → colorless                10.6 - 9.4
       2         phenolphthalein        colorless → pink → colorless                10.0 - 8.2
       3         phenol red             red → red → yellow                          8.0 - 6.6
       4         bromothymol blue       blue → blue → yellow                        7.6 - 6.0
       5         methyl red             orange → yellow → red                       6.0 - 4.8
       6         Universal indicator green → purple → orange
3.      Initial pH in all the test tubes is about 11.
4.      Dissolved CO2 reacts with water in the following manner:
            CO2 (aq) + H2O → H2CO3 (aq)
            H2CO3 (aq) + H2O → H3O+ (aq) + HCO3- (aq)
            HCO3- (aq) + H2O → H3O+ (aq) + CO32- (aq)
PREPARATION OF THE INDICATOR SOLUTION:
1.      Dissolve 0.04 gram of thymolphthalein in 50 mL of ethanol and dilute the resulting
        solution to 100 mL with distilled water.
2.      Dissolve 0.05 gram of phenolphthalein in 50 mL of ethanol and dilute the resulting
        solution to 100 mL with distilled water.
3.      Dissolve 0.04 gram of phenol red in 11 mL of 0.1 M NaOH and dilute the resulting
        solution to 100 mL with distilled water.
4.      Dissolve 0.04 gram of bromothymol blue in 6.4 mL of 0.01 M NaOH and dilute the
        resulting solution to 100 mL with distilled water. Dissolve 0.02 gram of methyl red in 60
        mL of ethanol and dilute the resulting solution to 100 mL with distilled water.
5.      To prepare Yamada’s universal indicator dissolve 0.005 gram thymol blue, 0.012 gram
        methyl red, 0.06 gram bromothymol blue, and 0.10 gram phenolphthalein in 100 mL of

      ethanol. Add enough 0.01 M sodium hydroxide until the solution is green and dilute the
      resulting solution to 200 mL with distilled water.
7.    To prepare 0.1 M sodium hydroxide dissolve 4.0 grams of NaOH in 500 mL distilled
      water and dilute the resulting solution to 1.0 liter with distilled water.
