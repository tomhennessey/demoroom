                                       Diffusion of Gases
Purpose
   To demonstrate the relationship between molar mass and diffusion rate of a gas.
Materials
   long glass tube open at each end                 ring stand and clamp
   HCl (conc)                                       ammonia (conc)
   2 rubber stoppers (to fit tube, with no          cotton balls
   holes)                                           2 petri dishes
Procedure
   1.     Clamp the tube horizontally on the ring stand.
   2.     Fill petri dishes with NH3 and HCl (seperately) and add cotton balls.
   3.     Take cotton ball from NH3 petri dish, place in end of tube and stopper. Fully cover
          the Petri dish.
   4.     Quickly do same with HCl cotton ball, place at opposite end of tube and stopper.
   5.     Observe a white ring (ammonium chloride) form after a few minutes. It should be
          closer to the side in which you place the ammonia cotton ball.
Additional Information
   1.     The results are only semi-quantitative due to air.
   2.     Results do not follow Graham’s Law of Effusion because the gases are diffusing
          through air.
Questions for the Students
   I.     What is the composition of the white ring which forms?
   II.    Why doesn’t the ring form instantaneously (What are the velocities of NH3 and HCl?)
   III.   Why doesn’t the ring form in the center of the tube?
Disposal
  1.      Any remaining solutions can be diluted and poured down the drain with excess water.
  2.      The tube should be rinsed out in the hood with water, collecting the runoff in a large
          beaker 1/3 filled with water.
  3.      Make sure the whole tube is rinsed before cleaning in the sink.
  4.      The solution in the beaker can be poured down the drain with excess water and the
          cotton balls thrown in the trash.
