             Different Colored Complexes with the Same Ligands
Procedure
        To demonstrate that different metal ions (with the same ligands) exhibit different
colors in a coordination complex.
Materials
        0.1 M solutions of copper nitrate and cobalt nitrate
        Four 250 mL beakers
        Concentrated aqueous ammonia
Procedure
    1. Add 100 mL of the copper nitrate to two of the beakers, 100 mL of the cobalt
        nitrate to the other two.
    2. Add the concentrated ammonia to one of the beakers to one of the beakers with
        the copper nitrate and to one of the beakers with the cobalt nitrate. Note that
        although the ammonia solution is clear, the colors actually get more intense (light
        blue to deep blue, pink to green blue).
Additional Information
    1. The reactions are:
                     Cu(H2O)42+(aq) + 4 NH3 ↔ Cu(NH3)42+(aq) + 4 H2O(l)
                     (pale blue)                (deep blue)
                     Co(H2O)62+(aq) + 6 NH3 ↔ Co(NH3)42+(aq) + 6 H2O(l)
                      (pink)                    (deep red)
    2. This demonstration can be used with a discussion of complex ion equilibria.
Additional Information
        Waste should be collected in a properly labelled container with UI# 203459.
