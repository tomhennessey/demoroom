                                          Roman Candle
Purpose
   To demonstrate a series of exothermic reactions accompanied with color changes, sparks, and
   smoke.
Materials
   Pyrex test tube (200 x 24 mm)                       Powdered Iron
   600 mL beaker with Sand                             Strontium Nitrate
   Sugar                                               Concentrated Sulfuric Acid
   Potassium Chlorate                                  Dropper
   Cupric Chloride
Procedure
   1.  Grind 35 g of potassium Chlorate and 10 g of Sugar separately.
   2.  Mix the potassium chlorate and sugar uniformly, but do not grind them together.
   3.  Immerse test tube into beaker of sand.
   4.  Starting at the base of the test tube, prepare four layers of chemicals as follows, being
       sure to mix each layer together.
           a. A mixture of 3 g of strontium nitrate and 9 g of potassium chlorate/sugar
                    i. Red Color
           b. A mixture of 2 g of cupric chloride and 10 g of potassium chlorate/sugar
                    i. Blue Color
           c. A mixture of 3 g powdered iron and 9 g of potassium chlorate/sugar
                    i. Yellow Color
           d. The remaining amount of the potassium chlorate/sugar mixture (~12g)
                    i. White Color
   5. Dim the lights and add 1-2 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid to the test tube and step
       back.
Additional Information
   1. By altering the amounts of powered iron and strontium salt, a more spectacular flame
       may result.
Disposal
   Once cool, the remaining solid can be removed from the test tube and placed in a solid waste
   container.
