     Different Colored Complexes with Different Number of Ligands
Purpose
       To demonstrate that the number of ligands (the same ligands) can alter the color
       of coordination complexes.
Materials
       1M NiCl2                                          Four 400 ml beakers
       Ethylenediamine (99%)                             Stirring Rods
Procedure
   1. Add 20mL of 1M NiCl2 to Beaker 1, Beaker 2, Beaker 3, and Beaker 4.
   2. Dilute each beaker with 280mL distilled water to yield a 300mL solution.
   3. Beaker 2:
            add ~1.0 mL of ethylenediamine. Stir the mixture to view a light blue color.
            If still green, add drops of ethylenediamine until light blue color appears.
   4. Beaker 3:
            add ~2.5 mL of ethylenediamine. Stir the mixture and a royal blue color
            should appear. If still green, add drops of ethylenediamine as done for
            beaker 2.
   5. Beaker 4:
            add ~4mL of ethylenediamine. Stir the mixture and a violet color should
            appear. If not, keep adding ethylenediamine as done for beaker 2 and 3.
Additional Information
    1. The reactions are:
       NiCl2 + 6 H2O → Ni(H2O)62+ + 2Cl-                                 (colorless to green)
       Ni(H2O)62+(aq) + en → [Ni(H2O)4(en)]2+(aq) + 2H2O(l)             (green to light blue)
       Ni(H2O)62+(aq) + 2en → [Ni(H2O)2(en)2]2+(aq) + 4H2O(l)          (green to royal blue)
       Ni(H2O)62+(aq) + 3en → [Ni(en)3]2+(aq) + 6H2O(l)                     (green to violet)

Safety
        Ethylenediamine is a corrosive, toxic, flammable liquid. Inhalation may be fatal
as a result of spasm, inflammation, and swelling of air passages. Can cause damage to
kidneys, liver and stomach pains, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wear safety goggles and
disposable gloves. If you prepare the chemicals for this demo, WORK IN THE HOOD
when pouring ethylenediamine into 10 mL beaker.
Disposal
     1. All of the waste from this experiment should go into the properly labeled waste
         containers with UI# 100944.
     2. Rinse all glassware with acetone first, then wash with regular soap and water.
