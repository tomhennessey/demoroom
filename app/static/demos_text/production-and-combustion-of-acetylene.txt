                        Production and Combustion of Acetylene
Purpose
       To demonstrate the generation and flammability of acetylene gas through a solid reacting
       with water.
Materials
       Metal Bowl                                            DI H2O Bottle
       Matches                                               Calcium Carbide
       Candle on a stick                                     (Must me relatively new)
Procedure
       1.      Add about 10g of solid calcium carbide to metal bowl. Add more calcium carbide
           if you want the reaction to last longer.
       2.      Add approximately 2-3 mL of H2O to the metal bowl to begin acetylene gas
           production.
       3.      Strike a match and light the candle on the stick. Carefully and quickly hold the
           flame over the burning calcium carbide to ignite the acetylene gas. A large flame of
           fire will be produced.
       4.      Add more H2O to the metal bowl to increase the intensity of the fire.
Safety
       Calcium carbide produces flammable acetylene gas upon contact with water. The calcium
       carbide may contain a contaminate resulting in the release of the toxic gas phosphine on
       contact with water. Be sure to use non-contaminated, fresh calcium carbide.
       Acetylene is highly flammable. Do not stand too close to metal bowl when igniting
       acetylene gas.
Disposal
       Add excess water to calcium carbide until bubbling does not persist. DO THIS IN THE
       HOOD DUE TO ACETYLENE GAS PRODUCTION.
       Place solid products in appropriate container and pour leftover liquid down the drain with
       excess water.
                                                                                          Gases 25
