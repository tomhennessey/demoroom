                                    Wolff Bottle (Tinkler)
Purpose
  To demonstrate the faster diffusion rate of hydrogen gas compared with air.
Materials
  Wolff bottle                                          stoppered bell jar
  Hydrogen gas                                          porous cylinder
  colored water                                         one hole stopper
  bent glass tubing
  Set up:
Procedure
  1.      Assemble the set-up as shown above.
  2.      Place the bell jar over the porous cylinder and pump hydrogen gas under the bell jar.
  3.      The colored water in the Wolff bottle will stream out through the bent glass tubing.
                                                                                        Gases 21

   1.      Because the hydrogen can travel into the porous cylinder faster than air can travel out
           of it, the pressure increases inside the cylinder. This causes the water to escape via
           the tubing.
Questions for the Students
   1.      How does the pressure inside the bell jar compare to the atmospheric pressure as
           hydrogen is added to it?
   2.      How does the pressure inside the porous cylinder compare to the atmospheric
           pressure as hydrogen flows into the bell jar? Explain.
