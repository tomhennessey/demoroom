                                      The Magic Genie
Purpose
   To demonstrate the rapid effect a catalyst has on the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.
Materials
   Florence flask covered with duct tape                 safety shield (optional)
   Rubber stopper                                        manganese dioxide
   100 mL beaker                                         30% hydrogen peroxide
Procedure
   1.     Measure out about 50 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide, using the 100 mL beaker, and
          pour it into the Florence flask.
   2.     Place about 2 spatulas of manganese dioxide into a Kimwipe, form it into a pouch, and
          tie it with a 20 cm piece of string. (Alternative: Empty a tea bag. Place 2 spatulas of
          MnO2 in the empty tea bag and re-staple to the string.)
   3.     Carefully suspend the pouch above the hydrogen peroxide and hold it in place with a
          rubber stopper.
   4.     Set up a story about a magic bottle.
   5.     Remove the stopper and STEP BACK. A large puff of steam will be released.
Additional Information
   1.     10% hydrogen peroxide can be used. It is not as dramatic, however.
   2.      H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2 (MnO2 is the catalyst)
   3.     Key concepts: role of a catalyst – exothermic reaction.
Question for the Students
   I.     Predict the products of the reaction.
Disposal
       The excess fluid in the Florence flask can be poured down the drain with excess water.
       The pouch containing the MnO2 should be removed from the flask and thrown away in
                                                                                  Reactions 11


       the trash. Be sure to thoroughly clean flask to ensure that the next time it is used, the
       demo will work.
