                                          Galvanic Cells
Purpose
   To show the basic principles of a galvanic cell.
Materials
   copper electrode (plate)                           1 M ZnSO4
   zinc electrode (plate)                             1 M CuSO4
   2 250 mL beakers                                   Clear voltmeter for overhead projector
   Salt bridge made of kimwipe soaked in
   saturated KNO3
Procedure
    1.      Set up the cell as in the picture below with the voltmeter on the overhead projector.
    2.         Properly assembled the voltmeter should read approximately 1.10 V.
Additional Information
    1.      Other solutions and electrodes can be substituted.
                                                                        Electrochemistry 1


     2.     The half-reactions are:
                                                            ℰ°(V)
               Zn2+ + 2 e− → Zn                             −0.76
               Cu2+ + 2 e− → Cu                             0.34
               The overall reaction is:
                                                                           ℰcell
               Zn + Cu2+ → Cu + Zn2+                 1.10 V
      3.    Application of the Nernst Equation can be shown by changing the concentration of
             the solutions.
                                 0.0592
               ℰcell = E ocell =        at 25°C

Questions for the Students
      1.       Which is the anode and cathode?
      2.       Which direction do the electrons flow?
      3.       What is the purpose of the salt bridge?
Disposal
   Solutions should be placed in properly labeled storage containers. Electrodes can be cleaned
   with 1M HCl.
