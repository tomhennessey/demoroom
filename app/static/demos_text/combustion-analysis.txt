                                 Combustion Analysis
Purpose
   To qualitatively observe the formation of CO2 and water product for a classic
   combustion reaction
Materials
   Candle                                        Calcium Hydroxide (0.1 M 50 mL)
   Jar and lid (2)                               Cobalt Chloride (0.1 M 50 mL)
   Matches                                       Small Filter Paper
Preparation
   1. Presoak small filter paper in 50 mL of 0.1 M Cobalt Chloride solution for at least
       one minute. Remove with tweezers and flame dry the paper at least 6 inches
       above a Bunsen burner flame until the paper is uniformly blue. Be careful not to
       burn the filter paper or your hand.
Procedure
   1. Invert an open jar 1 inch above the lit candle with the candle burning directly into
       the jar. This allows for an increased amount of product collection from the
       atmosphere outside of the jar. Allow the candle to burn for 30 seconds to 1
       minute.
   2. Smother the flame by placing the jar over the candle until the flame goes out.
       Immediately place the dry blue CoCl2 filter paper into the jar and secure the lid
       onto the jar after.
   3. Perform the same procedure for product collection in a separate jar, but instead
       pour 50 mL of 0.1 M Ca(OH)2 into the jar and then secure the lid.
Additional Information
   1. The blue filter paper will slowly become pink when the water product of
       combustion hydrates the CoCl2.
   2. The Ca(OH)2 will immediately go from a clear solution to a cloudy white solution
       in the presence of CO2. The solid precipitate that forms is CaCO3.
Disposal
    The CoCl2 paper can be flame dried and reused. Everything else can go down the
    drain with plenty of water.
