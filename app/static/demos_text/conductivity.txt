                                         Conductivity
Purpose
     To demonstrate the conductivity of a variety of substances in solution. To classify
     substances as weak, strong or nonelectrolytes.
Materials
     Conductivity apparatus                          NaCl
     Small beakers                                   Glacial acetic acid
     Distilled water/wash bottle                     1 M HC2H3O2
     Sugar                                           1 M HCl
Procedure
   1. Place distilled water in a beaker. Ask for prediction of conductivity. Test with apparatus.
   2. Place tap water in a beaker. Test for conductivity.
   3. Add sugar to distilled water. Test for conductivity.
   4. Begin with new beaker of distilled water. Add NaCl. Test.
   5. Test beaker of the acids in this order
           a) HCl
           b) 1 M HC2H3O2
           c) Glacial acetic acid
   6. Dilute glacial acetic acid by half (double the volume). Test conductivity.
   7. Repeat step 6. Test conductivity.
Additional Information
   1. Be sure to clean electrodes well in distilled water between tests.
   2. Be careful with electrodes – shock hazard!!!
Questions for the Students
   1. Why doesn’t distilled water conduct electricity?
                                                                         Solubility and Solutions 5


   2. Why does tap water conduct?
   3. What must be present for conductivity to occur?
   4. Why is 1 M HCl such a strong electrolyte? Draw a molecular picture.
   5. Why is 1 M HC2H3O2 a weak electrolyte? Draw a molecular picture. How is it different
       from HCl?
   6. Why is glacial acetic acid a nonelectrolyte?
   7. Why does it begin to conduct when we add distilled water?
Disposal
       Solutions can be poured down the drain with excess water.
