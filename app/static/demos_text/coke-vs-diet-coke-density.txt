                              Coke vs. Diet Coke - Density Test
Purpose
    To illustrate density by comparing regular and diet soda.
Materials
    1 can Coke or Pepsi
    1 can Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi
    4L beaker
Procedure
    1.      Fill beaker about 2/3 with water.
    2.      Ask students if diet soda is really diet (light).
    3.      Place both cans of soda in water.
    4.      Observe that diet soda floats and regular soda sinks.
Additional Information
    1. Test this before class. Sometimes several pairs of cans must be tested to find a successful
        pair.
    2. When immersing cans, tilt them to prevent getting a bubble on the bottom of the can
        which will affect the results.
Questions for the Students
    1.      Why does the regular soda sink?
    2.      If the volumes of the cans are the same, what is varying?
Disposal
   Cans can be reused for future demos.
