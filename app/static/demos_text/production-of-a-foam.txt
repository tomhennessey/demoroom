                                 Production of a Foam
Purpose
   To demonstrate the formation of a foam from two clear solutions.
Materials
   2 250 mL beakers                              laundry detergent (powdered)
   100 mL graduated cylinder                     Al2(SO4)3•18 H2O
   2 stirring rods                               NaHCO3
   mortar and pestle
                                                                 Liquids, Solids and Colloids 7


Procedure
   Preparation
       1.     Place 1.0 g laundry detergent and 7.0 g Al2(SO4)3 18 H2O in the mortar and grind
              it to a powder.
       2.     Place powder into a 250 mL beaker. Add 50 mL water and stir to dissolve. Label
              this Solution A.
       3.     Dissolve 5.0 g NaHCO3 in 50 mL of water in the second 250 mL beaker. Label
              this Solution B.
   Presentation
       1.     Pour A into B and mix quickly.
       2.     Invert the beaker to show the stability of the foam.
Additional Information
   1.     Reactions are:
             [Al(H2O)x]3+ + H2O ⇄ H3O+ + [Al(OH)(H2O)x!1]2+
             NaHCO3 (s) ➝ Na+ (aq) + HCO3−(aq)
             HCO3−(aq) ➝ H2O(l) + CO2(g)
   2.     A chemical foam contains CO2; a mechanical foam contains air.
                                                                   Liquids, Solids and Colloids 7


   3.     A foam is a colloidal system with a gas dispersed in a liquid.
   4.     Other foams include whipped cream, shaving cream.
Questions for the Students
   1.     What is a foam?
   2.     What reactions lead to the production of the foam?
   3.     How is this reaction similar to the reaction which produces CO2 during baking?
   4.     Name some other foams.
