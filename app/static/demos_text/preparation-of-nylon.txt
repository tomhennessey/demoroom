                                       Preparation of Nylon
Purpose
    To demonstrate the preparation of strands of nylon.
Materials
        Hooked glass rod                                 1,6-hexanediamine
        0.4 M NaOH                                       sebacoyl chloride
        display glass                                    Hexane
Procedure
    1.      Pour 50ml of 5% 1,6-hexanediamine into a display glass.
              a. To make 5% solution- dissolve 0.575g 1,6-hexanediamine in 12.5ml 0.4M NaOH
    2.      Pour 50mL of 2% sebacoyl chloride (in hexanes) into a 100mL beaker.
              a. To make 2% solution- dissolve 1mL sebacoyl chloride in 12.5mL hexane
    3.      Carefully pour the sebacoyl solution down the inside of the display glass so that it
            floats on the 1,6-hexanediamine solution. The nylon layer forms in between the two
            layers.
    4.      Use the glass rod to grasp the nylon formed between layers. Pull the nylon strand out
            of the display glass. It is possible to obtain several feet of nylon from this reaction.
Disposal
        Pour the mixture into a labeled waste container. Use acetone as needed to separate the
strands of nylon from the glass rod.
