                                        The Electric Pickle
Purpose
       To demonstrate the electrical conductivity of a pickle.
Materials
       large pickle
       2 forks
       an electrical cord: a plug at one end and the other end split with alligator clips attached
Procedure
      1.       Place the pickle on a large watch glass or petri dish.
      2.       Stick the forks into the pickle, parallel to each other, and about two inches apart.
               Do not allow the forks to touch at any point.
      3.       Attach an alligator clip to the ends of each fork, opposite of the prongs.
      4.       Plug the electrical cord into a power source.
      5.       The pickle will show a wavering yellowish glow in a few seconds. For best
               results, turn off the lights in the room.
Additional Information
       1.      Be very careful that the cord remains unplugged until everything is set. Then do
               not touch any of the metal parts until the cord is again unplugged.
       2.      The pickle can be stabilized on the bench by using a couple of toothpicks. Do not
               clamp the pickle in a metal clamp on a ring stand.
       3.      A multiple plug strip can be used to connect the apparatus to the power source.
               This provides and additional protection against the possibility of electric shock.
Disposal
       Pickle should be thrown in to the trash.
