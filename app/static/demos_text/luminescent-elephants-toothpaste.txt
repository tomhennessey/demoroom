                          Luminescent Elephant’s Toothpaste
Purpose
   To demonstrate the effect of a catalyst (MnO2) on the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.
Materials
   1000 mL graduated cylinder                            MnO2
   150 mL beaker                                         2-3 glow sticks
   50-75 mL liquid soap (Ajax)                           plastic tub
   50-100 mL 30% hydrogen peroxide
Procedure
   1. Place a 1000 mL graduated cylinder in a large plastic basin or dishpan.
   2. Add 50 to 75 mL of liquid dishpan soap.
   3. Dump in about a tablespoonful (15 mL) of MnO2 powder, and swirl to mix into a
       suspension of the black solid.
   4. Into a separate beaker pour 50 to 100 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide (HANDLE WITH
       CARE).
   5. Activate two or three light sticks of the desired color (high intensity types work best), cut
       them open with a razor blade knife, and empty the glowing contents into the beaker. The
       oily luminescent liquid will not mix with the H2O2 but stay as glowing droplets.
   6. Turn out the lights, swirl both containers, and pour the contents of the beaker into the
       cylinder which is centered in the basin.
   7. A luminescent column of suds with dark streaks will rise up and overflow the cylinder
       due to the decomposition of the H2O2 to H2O and O2 gas catalyzed by the MnO2.
Additional Information
   1.      When cleaning up and disposing of the remains be careful of the pieces of glass
           which were broken in the light sticks.
   2.      Ajax brand dish soap is essential for the reaction to glow. Dawn soap will not work.

   3.      The reaction is:
               2 H2O2  →
                          2 H2O + O2        (MnO2 is the catalyst)
Disposal
       Pieces from the glow sticks should be thrown away into the trashcan. Remaining
       solutions can be rinsed down the sink with excess water.
