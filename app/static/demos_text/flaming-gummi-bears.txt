                                   Flaming Gummi Bears
Purpose
   To illustrate rapid oxidation of sugar in the form of gummi bears.
Materials
   25 × 200 mm test tube                             KClO3 (reagent grade)
   ring stand / ring                                 gummi bears (stale)
   wire gauze                                        Fischer burner
   clamp (no plastic)
Procedure
   Preparation
       1.      Fill 25 × 200 mm test tube about ¼ with KClO3.
       2.      Set-up apparatus as shown:
       3.     Heat test tube evenly until KClO3 is completely melted – do this just before the
              demo is to be performed as once melted and solidified, the KClO3 cannot be re-
              melted.
   Presentation
       1. While KClO3 is hot and liquid, drop a gummi bear into tube and move back.
       2. Gummi bear will light up producing tall flame and dancing inside the test tube.
                                                                       Reactions: Exothermic 31


       3. Use care and add more gummi bears slowly.
Additional Information
   1. Watch out for your fingers and splattering of KClO3.
   2. Do not do this without a safety ring and wire gauze. KClO3 will light up if dropped on
       base.
   3. Cheetos can also be used in this demonstration. Stale cheetos work best.
Disposal
  The solid remnants of the KClO3 should be scraped out of the test tube as best as possible and
  placed in proper solid waste container. The remaining residue can be soaked to allow for
  easier removal and washed down the sink with excess water.
